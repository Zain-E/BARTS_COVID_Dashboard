# BARTS COVID Dashboard

This project is for a COVID dashboard that was created using Office of National Statistics (ONS) data.
It was created for an interview presentation at BARTS Health NHS Trust, with the intention to showcase my analytical and technical knowledge.
The dashboard uses Deprivation rates, ethnicity per population figures to find factors relating to COVID deaths.

It was a great success and I was offered the role!

The app itself runs on a Heroku server: https://id.heroku.com/login
